Update 04-05-2017
Changelog:

[h1]NEW:[/h1]
[list]
[*] New Shields: Adaptive Shields. Story wise: These shields have AI integrated systems allowing the shields to quickly adapt their frequencies and focus on incoming fire (more shield regeneration, less hp, regen in combat). Materialists only.
[/list]

[h1]CHANGES:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Advanced component techs won't show up before 80 years have passed in the game. Every 20 years after that there is a chance the next tiers show up.
[*] Ship Hangars, targeting matrix and other 'new' modules will show up a lot sooner. 
[*] Advanced component techs have a much higher chance to show up after a few years/decades if you still haven't gotten them. This to ensure no one has "too much bad luck".
[*] Advanced component techs are far more likely to show up when you have a Science Nexus megastructure. (+500%)
[*] IF you have the Utopia Expansion: The Last tier of advanced weapons tech will only start showing up if you have the Science Nexus Megastructure and 150 years have passed. This does not count for Ship Hangars, targeting matrix and other 'new' modules, they do not require the science nexus.
[*] If you don't have the Utopia Expansion: The last tier of advanced techs wonâ€™t show up until 150 years have passed.
[*] Advanced non-weapons techs are a bit more spread out in years. You won't see the next level until several years have passed.
[*] All weapons and module techs(in this mod) have 500% higher chance to show up in the tech tree if you have the Science Nexus Megastructure.
[*] Crystallis Infused shields are now Hivemind only (Same as hardened shields)
[*] Psionic Shields are Psionics only (psionic tech required) (more regeneration, less shield hp)
[*] Force Fields (Shields) are for everyone else.
[*] Robotic crews turned into AI Crew; only if you unlock droid robot workers tech. 
[*] AI crew is not materialist only. 
[*] Psionic crews turned into Psionic Crew: only if you have psionic tech.
[*] Clone crews turned into drone crew: Only with clone tech. Not if you are egalitarian.
[*] Purifier crews turned into purifier crew: only if you have civic: fanatic_purifier
[*] Slave ship crews turned into slave ship crew: only for Authoritarian empires.
[*] Civilian ship crews turned into regular ship crew: for everyone else.
[*] Volunteer crews removed.
[*] Base tech required to unlock crews is spaceport 5.
[*] Some weapon rebalance, back to following vanilla bonuses (armor pen/shield damage, etc).
[*] Laser Tier 6 and 7 dps slightly buffed.
[*] Autocannon Tier 4 and 5 dps slightly nerfed.
[*] Shield Capacitors tier 2 and 3 shield regeneration bonus reduced from 75%/100% to 60%/70%. Power requirements also reduced. 
[*] New tier 10 armor icon (finally it doesn't like shit)
[*] Research techs research bonus reduced from 9% each to 5% each
[/list]

[h1]FIXES:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Fixed autocannon sounds not working.
[*] A lot of localisation fixes.
[*] Science lab fixes so they work (following their 1.5 game curator lab fixes)
[/list]


In Short: Expect to hold an arms race with your enemies and allies every 20 years for the next tech advancements in weapons and components! The AI will aggressively try and tech these so you better keep up! Alternatively, steal the tech from their destroyed ships! ;)






Update 06-04-2017
	[b]Changes:[/b]
	[list]
	[*] Removed Power Core sub mod compatibility, will return in a seperate patch. This to fix a weird ship builder auto-complete bug.
	[*] Updated missile stats to match the game update changes
	[*] Changed psionic shield pre-requirements to require the new psionic shields from the base game.
	[/list]


Update 07-03-2017
	[b]Changes:[/b]
	[list]
	[*]increased extra dimentianal accuracy and damage for the new tiers.
	[*]removed the small hull regen bonus from crystaline armor
	[*]Crystalline Armor will now provide a small hull hp bonus
	[*]lowered the hull regen bonus from crystal infused plating to better balance endgame.
	[*]This mod's modules and weapons can now auto-upgrade to their next level when "auto-upgrade" is enabled in the ship builder.
	[*]Crystaline Reactor tech is a bit rarer now.
	[*] The following weapon systems new tiers fire rate has been reduced by half, but deal twice as much damage (so effective DPS remains the same). This to reduce graphical effect clutter late game when ships have a lot of bonus fire rate. This also makes for much more beautiful battle scenes!
	[*] - Plasma
	[*] - Rail guns
	[*] - Lasers
	[*] - Extra Dimentional
	[*] - Disruptor
	[*]Reverted previous changes to shield regeneration. Turns out ships ended up being far too hard to destroy with enough + shield regen modules and repeatable techs. It's back to the vanilla system where a small shield has more regen but less hp compared to medium and large shields. Example, small shield X now has 4.6 regen, medium X now has 6.6 regen (instead of 9.2), and large x now has 8.8 regen (instead of  18.4). 
	[*] Extra Dimentional weapons now have much cooler firing graphics (more plasma orb/beam)
	[*] Some tweaks to auxilary module AI weights
	[/list]
	
	[b]New stuff:[/b]
	[list]
	[*] Two new tiers of shield capacitors
	[*] Two new advanced bombers, one normal new tier and one "Extra-Dimensional Armed" which is unlocked after researching dimensional weapons. 
	[*] A new advanced fighter 
	[*] Tier 4 and 5 autocannons have new firing effects.
	[*]
	[/list]

Update 28-11-2016
	[b]Changes:[/b]
	[list]
	[*]Some of the new weapon tiers have had their negative bonuses removed to better balance them (see lasers doing less damage to shields). Hopefully endgame balance isn't all about kinetic anymore.
	[*]Missiles 6 max range has been increased by 25. (75/95/115 instead of 50/70/90)
	[*]Missiles 7 max range has been increased by 50. (100/120/140 instead of 50/70/90)
	[*]Swarm Missiles 3 max range has been increased by 20. (70 instead of 50)
	[*]Swarm Missiles 4 max range has been increased by 40. (90 instead of 50)
	[*]Torpedoes 4 max range has been increased by 70. (130 instead of 60)
	[*]Torpedoes 5 max range has been increased by 90. (150 instead of 60)
	[*]Energy Torpedoes 3 max range has been increased by 20. (90 instead of 70)
	[*]Energy Torpedoes 4 max range has been increased by 40. (110 instead of 70)
	[*]PD and Flak batteries new tiers also gain 5 increase in range each
	
	[*]Crystallis Reactors scale a bit more at higher tiers and provide a slight bit more power to compensate for the power requirements of the new weapons.
	[*]Changed the bonus research engineering and physics techs from +tile research bonuses to empire research bonuses. 
	[*]Made new weapon tiers, and last tiers of other modules a fair bit rarer in the tech tree. It should be less likely you get the next tier tech imediatly after researching the previous one.
	[*]Final tier techs are now clasified as "dangerous tech". This to make it clearer they are the final tier and to add a bit of flavour to the game.
	[*]Some module techs are now normal while later tiers of them are clasified as rare.
	[/list]
	
	[b]Icon changes:[/b]
	[list]
	[*]Improved/New ship crystallis reactor icons
	[*]New Crystalline Armor icons
	[*]Improved ALL technology icons, they now have a matching background to their field (physics/eng/soci)
	[/list]

Update 6-11-2016
	[b]Added new weapon effects for the following weapons:[/b]
	[list]
	[*]Energy Lances: Tetryon and Polaron
	[*]Disruptors: Resonant and Muon
	[*]Disintegrators: Improved and Matter-Energy
	[*]Arc Emitters: Vexed and Concerted
	[*]Cloud Lightning: Resonating and Luminous
	[/list]
	Some effects behave slightly different(cooler!) from their previous base game versions too!
	
	[b]bugfixes:[/b]
	[list]
	[*]Fixed Resonating and Luminous missing names in ship builder.
	[*]Fixed Missing Concerted arc emmiter icon.
	[/list]

	This to make them more unique in name and feel less boring.
	
	-----
	
	[list]
	[*]Ship crews are now cheaper in mineral cost.
	[*]Early Psionic Thrusters shield bonus reduced. Now provides 50/100/250/500 shield bonus instead of 200/300/400/500. This to balance early game a bit.
	[*]Ship crew stats lowered slightly to 4/8/12% (from 5/10/15%)
	[*]phase-shields/Psionic barriers/force-fields balance pass; lowered shield values, especially the high tier ones. Crystalline shields are base, psionic shields have 20% less shield hp but 20% more regen. Hardened shields have 20% more shield hp but 20% less regen. Regen values normalised across size.
	[*]Removed reactor damage bonus as we have new weapon tiers now.
	[*]Modules and weapons should now be nearly ordered under their vanilla counterparts! No more scrolling up and down so much!
	[/list]
	
	-----

Update 21-10-2016
	[list]
	
	[b]Changes:[/b]
	[*]Crystallis Armor values reduced to be in line with basegame armour and the new armour calculations. (with old values you could cap 90% reduction with just 3 modules.

[ui] Decimals, modules and ship designer

Hello

This suggestion probably applies to spaceports as well.

I have found several stats/modifiers that do not show a decimal and instead round up/down. This makes is pretty hard to balance for mods that use these moddifiers. Especially on modules where a small decimal value needs to be used if you want to use small/med/large modules.

This happens non-decimal display is apparent on:
ship modules
ship designer
ship inspecting (space)
spaceports

The game registers and uses decimals, but the ui rounds up/down. Would it be possible to make it universally follow the same rules as some other stats? If round number, show round number (eg: 2), if number has decimal value, show decimal value (eg: 2.5, or 2.25). 

Some of the modifiers that round up/down:
ship_accuracy_add

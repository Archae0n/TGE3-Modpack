If the espionage mission succeeds, the spying empire will generally gain one intrigue point on the target empire. You also cannot wait the event out as the target empire because the result event WILL fire and not picking anything always lead to a result that benefits the spying empire.\n\nSabotage missions are similar to regular espionage missions but instead will always give the target empire a bad modifier and a special project as opposed to an event chain.
